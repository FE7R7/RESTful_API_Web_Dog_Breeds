About the Project:

Web Application Topic:
The Dog breeds web application provides to the user information about different characteristics of each dog breed, allowing the user to learn more and better understand the profile of each dog, whether out of curiosity for those who love these four-legged friends or even to find the one that best fits the person's life context, aiming at the well-being of the animal and also of those who will live with the new member of the family.

Application Goal: 
Implement client-side functionalities in the front-end and connect them with a RESTful API, ensuring integration within the system's lifecycle and enabling interaction with the backend database for data persistence and retrieval.

CRUD and Plus Actions: 
Get All Dogs records Get One Dog record by ID Get One Dog record by Breed Name Add a New Dog Update the Records of an existing Dog Delete the Records of a Dog

Extra Web-Client functionalities: 
Clean fields button Gallery to display Next and Previous picture Clickable links to redirect user to external information

Project Components:
PHP / SLIM / Bootstrap / jQuery / HTML / CSS / JavaScript / MySQL / XAMPP to run Apache Web Server and MySQL Server /  DBeaver Workbench for managing Database

Frameworks and AJAX:
To support the formatting of the page's style and appearance, in addition to CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery were used. I decided to use the CDN (Content Delivery Network) approach where you link to a web-hosted resource instead of downloading and hosting it locally.
AJAX is being used as a JavaScript technique to make efficient requests with APIs to the server, loading data dynamically, which is one of its biggest advantages.
